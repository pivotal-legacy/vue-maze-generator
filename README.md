# Vue Maze Generator

> A simple Vue.js app which generates a random maze using the Binary Tree algorithm.

This app was created as a way to try out Vue.js.

## What does it look like?

![A picture of a maze](maze.jpg?raw=true "It's Amazing!")

## Running it

``` bash
npm install
npm test # to run tests
npm run dev # Then go to http://localhost:8080/
```

## Acknowegements

The idea was based on the second chapter of [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) and the Javascript code here borrows a lot from the Ruby sample code in the book.
